I am a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> based in India. I am a passionate developer, open source enthusiast, and a coder who loves the web platform ( Specially JavaScript ).

Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy creating content on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPtj3gx8MtsyoXjX0kP1hQ).
